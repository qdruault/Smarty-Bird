# Smarty Bird!

Trying to create an AI able to beat a *Flappy Bird* game. All the birds have a unique neural network (MLP) ; the best ones are selected and then recreated based on a genetic algorithm. This project is based on [Daniel Shiffman's tutorial](https://github.com/CodingTrain/Toy-Neural-Network-JS/tree/master/examples/neuroevolution-flappybird) and uses [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) for the graphical rendering.
